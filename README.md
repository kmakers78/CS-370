Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The purpose of this project was to create an algorithm that had an agent that would navigate a maze in order to find the endpoint as efficiently as possible.
The code that was provided was the Enviroment, Experience for replay, Build model, and Play game code. I created the code for the Q-training algorithm.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer science is the study and development of technology around the world of various fields. It is critical as the world is rapidly adapting
technology to everyday life at an increasing rate. To keep current with the world around us, it's best to be in the tech world. Computer scientists
help provide the functionality and maintain these systems that everyone uses from personal, commercial, industrial, recreational, etc uses.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I first try to identify the problem, and the goal of the problem. What is the issue, and what is needed to solve it?
From there I break the solution concept into like portions to help the development of the product be streamlined and adaptable should it need to be changed in the future.
Excessive testing is needed to ensure all components are functioning as intended, and getting as much outside feedback as possible along the process helps provide
unique perspective on the issue and the fuctionality of the end product.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end user are to remain unbias in development and deployment. The goal is to provide product that can be used by as many
people as possible without limiting users based on ethical concerns. My own personal opinions, views, and beliefs are not to be implemented into the product
to ensure the uniformity and ethical balance within the product.
